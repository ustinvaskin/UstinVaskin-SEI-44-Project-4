# We created this file it was not here by default. What we are doing here is making a custom authentication method for ourselves that uses JWT tokens, much the same way our express apps did. What if effectively becomes is our secure route handler. If the user had a valid token, we allow them onto whatever they wanted to, handily attaching the users id to the request on its way, so we can know who they are when they perform actions. I do this all over this app in the 'jwt.views.py' for the profile route (finding the user by the request.user) and in the 'posts/views.py' where I attach the user to created posts.

from rest_framework.exceptions import PermissionDenied
from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model  # accessing our user model
# to get our secret key, we used it to encode a jwt token on login, we need it here to decode one that is sent with a request

# using that get user model function to get our custom user model

# This class is almost line for line identical to the secure route handler in our express app from module 3. Even more noticable if you put them side by side. althouth the syntax is slightly different, the actions and logic taken are exactly the same
# class JWTAuthentication(BasicAuthentication):

#     def authenticate(self, request):

#         if not header.startswith('Bearer'): # if the authorization header is there, but does not start wih the word Bearer

#         except jwt.exceptions.InvalidTokenError: # but if we couldnt decode it, there was error and we send back this invalid token message
#             raise PermissionDenied({'message': 'Invalid Token'})

#             raise PermissionDenied({'message': 'User not found'})

#         return (user, token) # if all was good we return our found authenticated user, and the token used, in a tuple. This then attaches itself to the incoming request object. The user will be found as 'request.user' and the token on 'request.auth'. This is then used extensiviely in this app to attach users and owners to resources like comments and posts.
